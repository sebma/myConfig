# configuration file for hdate - Hebrew date information program

# Should you mangle this file and wish to restore its default content,
# rename or delete this file and run hdate; hdate will automatically
# regenerate the default content.
#
# Your system administrator can set system-wide defaults for hcal by
# modifying file <not yet implemented>.
# You may override all defaults by changing the contents of this file.

# Version information
# This may be used by updates to hcal to determine how to parse the file

#
# Location awareness
# hdate wants to accurately highlight the current Hebrew day, including
# during the hours between sunset and secular midnight. If you don't
# provide it with latitude, longitude, and time zone information, hdate
# will try to guess the information, based upon your system timezone,
# and its (limited, and maybe biased) of the dominant Jewish community
# in that timezone. When hdate is forced to guess, it alerts the user
# with a message that includes the guessed location.
# hdate's guesses will also affect its default behaviour for output of
# Shabbat times, parshiot, and choice of Israel/diaspora hoidays.
#SUNSET_AWARE=TRUE
# LATITUDE and LONGITUDE may be in decimal format or in the form
# degrees[:minutes[:seconds]] with the characters :'" as possible
# delimiters. Use negative values to indicate South and West, or
# use the abbreviated compass directions N, S, E, W.
#LATITUDE=
#LONGITUDE=
# TIMEZONE may may be in decimal format or in the form degrees[:minutes]
# with the characters :'" as possible delimiters.

# Output in hebrew characters
# hdate defaults to output all information in your default language, so
# if your default language is Hebrew, you're all set. Otherwise, you can
# set FORCE_HEBREW to true to output Hebrew information in Hebrew, while
# still outputting gregorian information in your default language. To
# output ALL information in Hebrew, run something like this:
#    LC_TEMP=LC_ALL; LC_ALL="he_IL.UTF-8"; hdate; LC_ALL=$LC_TEMP
# If setting FORCE_HEBREW to true results in 'garbage' or non-Hebrew
# output, you need to install a terminal font that includes the Hebrew
# character set (hint: unicode).
#FORCE_HEBREW=FALSE

# The FORCE_HEBREW option outputs data that is 'correct' and 'logical'.
# Unfortunately, the world can not be depended upon to be either. Most
# Xwindow applications will display the data fine with FORCE_HEBREW; most
# xterm implementations will not. (in fact, the only xterm clone I know
# of that comes close is mlterm). If using FORCE_HEBREW results in
# Hebrew characters being displayed in reverse, set OUTPUT_BIDI to true.
# This will reverse the order of the Hebrew characters, so they will
# display 'visual'ly correct; however, such output will not be suitable
# for piping or pasting to many other applications. Setting OUTPUT_BIDI
# automatically forces hebrew.
#OUTPUT_BIDI=FALSE

# The Hebrew language output of Hebrew information can also be 'styled'
# in the following ways:
# option YOM ~> yom shishi, aleph tishrei ...
# option LESHABBAT ~> yom sheni leshabbat miketz, kof kislev ...
# option LESEDER ~> yom sheni leseder miketz, kof kislev ...
#YOM=FALSE
#LESHABBAT=FALSE
#LESEDER=FALSE

#TIMES_OF_DAY=FALSE
#SHORT_FORMAT=FALSE
#SEFIRAT_HAOMER=FALSE
#DIASPORA=FALSE


# Shabbat related
# Setting SHABBAT_INFO true will output parshiot and Shabbat times.
# The command line options for these features are -r (--parasha), and
# -c. The CANDLE_LIGHTING field can accept a value of 18 - 90 (minutes
# before sunset). The HAVDALAH field can accept a value of 20 - 90
# (minutes after sunset).

#ONLY_IF_HOLIDAY=FALSE

# Tabular output
# This option has hdate output the information you request in a single
# comma-delimited line per day, suitable for piping or import to
# spreadsheet formatting applications, etc. To belabor the obvious,
# try running -   ./hdate 12 2011 -Rt --table |column -s, -t 
# The command line option for this feature is, um, --table
#TABULAR=FALSE

# iCal format
# hdate can output its information in iCal-compatable format
# ICAL=FALSE
# Suppress alerts and warnings
# hdate alerts the user via STDERR when it guesses the user's location.
#QUIET_ALERTS=FALSE

# Julian day number
# The Julian day number is a .... See ... for more details.
# setting the option JULIAN_DAY will have hdate output that number in
# the format JDN-nnnnnnn at the beginning of its first line of output.
#JULIAN_DAY=FALSE

# User-defined menus
# You may specify here command-line strings to optionally be parsed
# by hcal at execution time. To do so, use the command line option -m
# (--menu). hcal will process first the settings of this config file,
# then the other settings of your command line, and then will prompt
# you for which menu item you would like to select. hcal will process
# your menu selection as if it were a new command line, further modifying
# all the prior settings.
# Only the first ten "MENU=" entries will be read. Each line will be
# truncated at one hundred characters
#MENU= -bd -l -23.55 -L -46.61 -z -3 # parents in Sao Paolo
#MENU= -b -l 32 -L 34 -z 2           # son in bnei brak
#MENU= -bd -l 43.71 -L -79.43 -z -5  # me in Toronto
#MENU= -bd -l 22.26 -L 114.15 -z 8   # supplier in Hong Kong
