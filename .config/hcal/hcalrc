# Your system administrator can set system-wide defaults for hcal by

# You may override all defaults by changing the contents of this file.

# Location awareness
# hcal wants to accurately highlight the current Hebrew day, including
# during the hours between sunset and secular midnight. If you don't
# provide it with latitude, longitude, and time zone information, hcal
# will try to guess the information, based upon your system timezone,
# and its (limited, and maybe biased) of the dominant Jewish community
# in that timezone. When hcal is forced to guess, it alerts the user
# with a message that includes the guessed location.
# hcal's guesses will also affect its default behaviour for output of
# Shabbat times, parshiot, and choice of Israel/diaspora hoidays
#SUNSET_AWARE=TRUE
# LATITUDE and LONGITUDE may be in decimal format or in the form
# degrees[:minutes[:seconds]] with the characters :'" as possible
# delimiters. Use negative values to indicate South and West, or
# use the abbreviated compass directions N, S, E, W.

# TIMEZONE may may be in decimal format or in the form degrees[:minutes]

TIMEZONE=+2

# Israel and the diaspora
# If hcal guesses that you're not in Israel, the DIASPORA option will be
# set true. This will affect holiday and parasha output.  FORCE_ISRAEL
# forces hcal to display calendar information for Israel, using hcal's
# default coordinates foe Israel, or coordinates that you provide that
# seem legitmately within Israel.
# Thus, if you are living in Sao Paolo, and will be visiting Israel for
# Sukkot, set BOTH flags true in order to see holiday information for
# a non-resident vistor to Israel. The command line options for these
# features are --israel, -I, --diaspora, -d.
#FORCE_DIASPORA=FALSE;
#FORCE_ISRAEL=FALSE;

# Shabbat related
# Setting SHABBAT_INFO true will output parshiot and Shabbat times.
# The command line options for these features are -p (--parasha), and
# -s (--shabbat). The CANDLE_LIGHTING field can accept a value of 18 - 90 (minutes
# before sunset). The HAVDALAH field can accept a value of 20 - 90
# (minutes after sunset).
#PARASHA_NAMES=FALSE
#SHABBAT_INFO=FALSE
#CANDLE_LIGHTING=FALSE
#HAVDALAH=FALSE

# Holiday identification
# hcal flags holidays by replacing the gregorian/Hebrew date separator
# with assorted unhelpful cryptic symbols. Setting FOOTNOTES to true
# will have hcal output after the month's calendar, a list of the month's
# holidays along with the days on which they occur.
#FOOTNOTE=FALSE

# Output in hebrew characters
# hcal defaults to output all information in your default language, so
# if your default language is Hebrew, you're all set. Otherwise, you can
# set FORCE_HEBREW to true to output Hebrew information in Hebrew, while
# still outputting gregorian information in your default language. To
# output ALL information in Hebrew, run something like this:
#    LC_TEMP=LC_ALL; LC_ALL="he_IL.UTF-8"; hcal; LC_ALL=$LC_TEMP
# If setting FORCE_HEBREW to true results in 'garbage' or non-Hebrew
# output, you need to install a terminal font that includes the Hebrew
# character set (hint: unicode).
# The command line option for FORCE_HEBREW is either --hebrew or -H
#FORCE_HEBREW=FALSE

# The FORCE_HEBREW option outputs data that is 'correct' and 'logical'.
# Unfortunately, the world can not be depended upon to be either. Most
# Xwindow applications will display the data fine with FORCE_HEBREW; most
# xterm implementations will not. (in fact, the only xterm clone I know
# of that comes close is mlterm). If using FORCE_HEBREW results in
# Hebrew characters being displayed in reverse, set OUTPUT_BIDI to true.
# This will reverse the order of the Hebrew characters, so they will
# display 'visual'ly correct; however, such output will not be suitable
# for piping or pasting to many other applications. Setting OUTPUT_BIDI
# automatically forces hebrew.
# The command line option for OUTPUT_BIDI is either --bidi, --visual, or -b
#OUTPUT_BIDI=FALSE

# Display enhancements
# hcal defaults to display the current day in reverse video
# The command line option for this feature is --no-reverse
#SUPPRESS_REVERSE_VIDEO=FALSE;
# hcal can display its output "calming, muted tones". Note that piping
# colorized output may yield unexpected results.
#COLORIZE=FALSE

# HTML OUTPUT
#OUTPUT_HTML=FALSE
#USE_EXTERNAL_CSS_FILE="pathto/foo/bar"

# Suppress alerts and warnings
# hcal alerts the user via STDERR when it guesses the user's location.
#QUIET_ALERTS=FALSE
QUIET_ALERTS=TRUE

# Three month display
# hcal can display a previous, current and next month side-by-side. hcal
# can also display a calendar for an entire year in four rows of three
# months each. Note that this will display properly only if your console
# is set for at least 127 columns. Note also that setting this option to
# will cause options FOOTNOTES, SHABBAT, and PARASHA_NAMES to false.
#THREE_MONTH=FALSE

# User-defined menus
# You may specify here command-line strings to optionally be parsed
# by hcal at execution time. To do so, use the command line option -m
# (--menu). hcal will process first the settings of this config file,
# then the other settings of your command line, and then will prompt
# you for which menu item you would like to select. hcal will process
# your menu selection as if it were a new command line, further modifying
# all the prior settings.
# Only the first ten "MENU=" entries will be read. Each line will be
# truncated at one hundred characters
#MENU= -l -23.55 -L -46.61 -z -3      # parents in Sao Paolo
#MENU= -l 32 -L 34 -z 2               # son in bnei brak
#MENU= -fbc -l 43.71 -L -79.43 -z -5  # me in Toronto
#MENU= -l 22.26 -L 114.15 -z 8        # supplier in Hong Kong
